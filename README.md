# Database Design and Implementation

A relational database project designed to manage operations in a dental clinic. This system includes doctors, patients, appointments, treatments, and payment trackingâ€”implemented using MySQL with a real-world schema.



## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Design and implement a normalized, relational database system for a dental office, supporting key functions like scheduling, billing, and treatment tracking.



## ðŸ’¡ Skills Learned

- SQL database design & normalization  
- Creating Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  
- Writing DDL (CREATE TABLE) and DML (INSERT) statements  
- Defining primary/foreign keys & relational integrity  
- Crafting meaningful, real-world queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.  
- Simulating a healthcare-like environment in SQL  



## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- MySQL  
- SQL scripts (`.sql`, `.txt`)  
- ERD Diagram (PDF)
- MySQL Workbench for visualization  



## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DentalOffice_SQL_Script.txt` | Main SQL script for creating DB and inserting data |
| `DentalOffice_Data.sql` | Backup copy of the same SQL script |
| `ERD + Tables.pdf` | Diagram showing relationships between tables |
| `sample_queries.sql` | A set of example queries for demonstration and testing |




## Sample Queries Include:

- List all appointments with doctor/patient info  
- Group payments by method  
- Patients who received expensive treatments  
- Appointments per doctor
